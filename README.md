# TagAR

### We initially started our application on ViroReact platform. This platform did not allow us to use certain libraries. So as a group we decided to use React-Native. This is the old link for our old github page. TagAR is a digital graffiti application, that allows users to upload and create a digital graffiti tag and leave it at any location and view it in augmented reality.
