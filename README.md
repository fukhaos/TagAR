# TagAR

 We initially started creating our application on ViroReact platform. We soon realized that this was the wrong approach for creating our application. So as a group we decided to use React-Native. This is the old link to our old github page(https://github.com/tag-digital-graffiti/tag-react-native). TagAR is a digital graffiti application, that allows users to upload and create a digital graffiti tag and leave it at any location, and view it in augmented reality.



This repository contains the front end source code, built using ViroReact, Redux, and React Native. There is a separate git project deployed to Heroku which serves as the backend server(https://github.com/tag-digital-graffiti/tag-server)
