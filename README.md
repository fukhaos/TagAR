# Tag - an Overview

TagAR is a digital graffiti application that allows users to upload or create an image and project it in augmented reality. This project is built in React-Native using the ViroAR library. The backend is built with Express and PostgresSQL, using Cloudinary as a database to store our user images. Please note our server code is in a separate repository on this project.

To get a full picture of our commits as a team, you may visit: https://github.com/tag-digital-graffiti/tag-react-native. We created this new repo to include a Podfile so that we may incorporate multiple libraries (React-Native Sketch Canvas and React-Native Google Maps) into our project.

Below are screenshots of the user flow of the mobile application and further down are instructions on how you can locally run this application on your Mac/iPhone.
